# UberDoku

This is a Sudoku game designed for an Uber job application.

## Technologies

In addition to HTML & CSS I used jQuery, Sass, and Jasmine for tests

## Implementation

I wanted to keep it simple, so I went ahead with the provided board. My first run through, I also used the provided solution but later went back and made a more robust solution checker.

The current implementation marks an invalid input as red. I'm comfortable with this gameplay as I think it's typical, but I would have liked to make it an optional feature for the user.

To make the design adaptive, I used two breakpoints for mobile and tablet. Visually, these breakpoints appeared to display well on all the devices types and browsers that I checked.
